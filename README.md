The  following  code  libraries  were  developed  by  myself  with  the  purpose  of  providing
anyone who would like to check the reproducibility of results in any of my publications or
that would like start working in the area of digital disease surveillance and have a tool that
helps them leverage all the process from data extraction to model benchmarking.


The following software libraries are presented:

1.  DBscrape:  DBscrape is a library developed to mine data from various online datasources (Such as Google Correlate, Google Trends API, Flunet, and IMSS sinave)
that are used for producing Influenza surveillance in Latin America.
2.  Data:  A library designed to read data from multiple sources and merges them into
an object that that contains some pre-processing functions and filters that prepares
the data for the experiment.
3.  Experiment: The library used to perform data modelling and prediction that can be
scaled to multiple areas
4.  Visualizer: A library thatâ€™s used to benchmark and visualize the input data to aid inthe EDA and also the results
generated form the models in Experiment

All code is developed using Python version 3.4
