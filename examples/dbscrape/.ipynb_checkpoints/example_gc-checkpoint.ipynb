I use some influenza data in a csv form (see the file for the format of the data) from Flunet in Mexico and input the file path in the correlate_from_csv method. timeseries_name is an identifier (if you didn't input a download_folder value, I suggest you use a meaningful identifier that lets you differentiate the file from the others). When you finish downloading the data, you'll see it is named \"correlate-<timeseries_name>.csv\". If you chose to input your download_folder, the file will be renamed \"<country>-<timeseries_name>.csv\".\n",
